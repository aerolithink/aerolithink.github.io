> Think like an aerolith.

It has been a long time since I wanted to establish a personal Blog. I used to do some writing to record things in dribs and drabs in OneNote and JianShu. bue I always feel that it has no sense of ritual in this way.

However, my procrastination baffled my action and the calender of building a personal Blog was then put on the shelf.

Then one day, I chatted with Resuly about the domain address. I said that the suffixes of domain address are increasing rapidly. Like ".Top", ".me", ".ink", so many choices for sale in the shopwindow. Resuly still as usual strongly urged me to register a domain as soon as possible.

I was still leisurely browsing a variety of domain names, when an Latin word sparkled across my mind - Aerolith
(Why is Aerolith? I majored in Geotechnical/Geological Engineering before.)

"Wow!" I almost shouted out. From that moment, I made my decision withou any hesitatation.

** Aerolith.ink **

Perhaps this is the "At First Sight".
