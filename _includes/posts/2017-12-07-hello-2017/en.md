Hi! You're here.

My name is Jiaying, Chen (Aaron for short).

This is my Blog - **_Aerolith.ink_**



I will record some text here in the future, they may have some of the following features.

- [x] &nbsp;Things about my major *Communication and Transportation Engineering*.
- [x] &nbsp;Some tips and tricks, you may never thought of, that I sum up when I struggle in the world of coding.
- [x] &nbsp;Some boundless reveries and wicked ideas. Just think like an aerolith. **:P**
- [x] &nbsp;Some things that are not necessarily useful but  full of joy and worth a try **:D** Don't you think It's not the "useful" but the "insteresting" that matters? **:)**
- [x] &nbsp;Some spices in life.
- [ ] &nbsp;To be continued...

Finally, Welcome to my home. I would appreciate your comments in the following days. **:)**
